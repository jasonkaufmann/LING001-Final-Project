    "The Vector Space Model for information retrieval is an interesting linguistic analysis technique. The paramount issue with language processing is representing words mathematically to do relevant computations. So, the Vector Space Model was developed to allow words to be represented as vectors! Using the model, we can find the similarity between a document and a query, which will tell us the relative importance of the query to the document. "

    "Zipf's law states that the rank of an entity - such as word - in a set will be inversely proportional to the number of times the entity shows up. For instance, in English, the most popular word - \"the\" - accounts for roughly 6% of all the words we say. By Zipf's law, the second most common word - \"of\" - will occur half as often as \"the\", which it mysteriously does, and so on for all subsequent words. This property seems to permeate all of nature and is even built into how we think. However, even though there have been many research papers studying Zipf's Law, no conclusive evidence has been discovered."

    "Moreover, this means that a majority of the words we write and say do not have much meaning. They are only there to space out and connect the meaningful/important concepts. This is why the Vector Space Model works so well. Even if a word appears hundreds of thousands of times in a corpus, it's importance will be diminished. In the Harry Potter books, the word \"the\" occurs all the time, but it gives no information about the plot of the books. The Vector Space Model takes advantage of the Zipf-ian nature of language to extract important terms from a corpus. Below, we use the Vector Space Model to do exactly that. In addition, we show that the Harry Potter books do in fact follow a Pareto distribution, which mathematicallly represent Zipf's law."

The downside to this is that meaning takes long to convey. The Zipf-ian nature of language seems to have caused verboseness to be an inherent part of our language. If every word we said had equally influential meaning, then communication could occur much more efficiently. The question is whether the human brain would be capable of producing coherent information that quickly. Unfortunatly, that is probably not the case. Moreover, for the listener, the meaning is not always easy to find since it exists in a sea of meaningless words. You have to be constantly listening for the important parts because if you lose focus for a brief time, you may miss them. In all, it would make sense for language to evolve for ease of production and retention, but that doesn't seem to be the case. It may be that we are in the nascent stages of language and it may take longer for it to reach its maximum potential."

    "In this experiment, I was attempting to uncover the interlinked nature of literature and film through analyzing the content of the Harry Potter books. More specifically, I wanted to see how well the characters in the books were depicted on-screen. To do this, I used the cosine similarity of a characterâ€™s name and each book as a proxy for the relative importance of the term. I believe this is a fair assumption because, many times, the use of a name indicates that the character had a line of dialogue, which directly relates to them being onscreen. In addition, the use of a characterâ€™s name in any regard works to increase their importance in the overall scheme of the book as it shows they are more integral to the plot. My hypothesis was that the higher the cosine similarity (loosely translated as the importance of the name in the book), the higher the screen time for that character. "

    "This experiment confirmed my hypothesis and showed that the importance of the characters in the books was accurately portrayed through the film. As seen from the graph above, the relationship is linear with an $r^2$  value of 0.974, which indicates a strong positive correlation. This implies that the movie closely mirrored the events in the books and each characterâ€™s contributions. Interestingly, as much as Voldemort is a major component of the plot of many of the films, his screen time doesnâ€™t correlate that well with the weight of his name in each of the books. This makes sense though as Voldemort is talked about a lot by other characters, increasing his cosine-similarity, but only present during the tension and action filled scenes towards the end of films. \n",
